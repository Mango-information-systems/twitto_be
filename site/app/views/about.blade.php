	<h2 id="intro">Intro <small> What is twitto.be all about</small></h2>
	<p>
		Twitto.be is a directory referencing Belgian twittos (users of twitter). It was launched in June 2013. It lets you explore the belgian twittosphere based on their location (province in Belgium), topics and language. <a href = "http://klout.com" target = "_blank">Klout</a> influence scores are used to rank the people.
	</p>
	<p>
		Twitto.be was created and designed by <a href="http://mango-is.com" target="_blank">Mango Information Systems SPRL</a>, a Belgian company active in social media analysis and monitoring. Panagiotis Synetos from <a href="http://11dig.it" target="_blank">11 Digit Labs</a> took care of most of the web development.
	</p>

	<h2 id="history">History<small> where the idea came from</small></h2>

	<p>While working on <strong><a href="http://tribalytics.com" target="_blank">tribalytics</a>, a tool helping marketers plan their marketing campaigns on twitter</strong>, we extracted about 200 000 twitter users from in Belgium. At about that time, <a href="https://twitter.com/vinch01" target="_blank">@vinch01</a> announced <a href="http://www.vinch.be/blog/2013/05/12/recherche-repreneurs-pour-le-projet-klout-be/" target="_blank">he was planning on retiring klout.be service</a> he had launched. Knowing about who is using twitter in Belgium is a recurring question, and we felt like having an exhaustive public directory, available for free, would be something useful.
	</p>

	<p>
		We also wanted to demonstrate the possibilities in multi-dimensional exploration (aka. faceted browsing) of data and designed the tool to be filterable using multiple structured criteria at a time. This way, results for niches can easily be accessed.
	</p>

	<p>
		From the 600000+ twitter accounts of our database, we analyzed location field, and could reliably identify 90000+ of them as matching with a location in Belgium. This was the initial dataset visible in twitto, which we expanded progressively.
