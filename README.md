# Twitto_be #

twitto_be (pronounce *tweet-to-be*) is an online directory of twitter users aimed at helping search and identify active twitter users. People are browsable by influence score, topics, location or keywords.

You can use it to create your own directory.

A demo can be seen at [twitto.be](http://twitto.be), where close to 100000 Belgian twitter users are referenced.

*very much a work in progress in the moment*

This repository contains the website's structure and logic. Individual twitter users and related information is not included.
