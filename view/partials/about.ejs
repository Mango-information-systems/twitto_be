	<h2>Twitto.be is closed</h2>

	<p>Hi, following some changes on how twitter provides access to its data, I have decided to close down this website, and archive <a href="https://github.com/Mango-information-systems/twitto_be">twitto's source code</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Twitto has been online since 2013, and caught the interest and engagement of Belgian twitter users. An average of 5000 people visited the website each year, and the <strong>tweets sent by @twitto_be reached 350k people every year</strong>. If you'd like to know more about what twitto was, read the <a href="https://alef.website/projects/twitto-be?utm_source=twitto-be&utm_medium=twitto-be&utm_campaign=generic">story of twitto.be</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Is it actually the end of the twitto? Well, not completely: my friend and client Dusan hired me to create a variant of twitto.be, focusing on the EU affairs. This version is hosted in website <a href="https://vattel.com/">vattel.com</a>.</p>
	
	<p>If you also would like to host a realtime tweets dashboard about any topic, get in touch on my new site <a href="https://alef.website/contact?utm_source=twitto-be&utm_medium=twitto-be&utm_campaign=generic">alef.website</a>.</p>
